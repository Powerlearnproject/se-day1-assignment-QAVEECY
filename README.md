# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the systematic application of engineering methods to develop and maintain high quality systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Structured Programming
Advent of Object-Oriented Programming
Rise of Agile Methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Waterfall method-this is sequential approach with dintinct phases
Srum method-Has agile framework focused on small, self-organising teams working on short iteration(sprints)
Agile method-this is iterative and increamental focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to changes

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Fexibility to change:
Waterfall is rigid and difficult to accept change since once a stage is done, it's done whereas in agile changes can easily be implemented
Testing:
in waterfall testing is done after implementation making it difficult to to dicover critical issues while in agile, continous testing ensures eradication of any issue
Documentation and client involvement:
For waterfall, intensive documentaion at each phase with client involvment being limited while for agile, it Focuses on working software and team communication over extensive documentation, with regular customer involvement throughout the development process for ongoing feedback.
Examples of scenarios.
waterfall is appropriate for developing medical and aviation software
Agile is good for web application development

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer:
-requirement analysis
-Software design
Quality Assuarance Engineer
-User Acceptance Testing
-Quality Metrics and Reporting
Project Manager
-Team management 
-Communication
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-they enhance productivity
-Provides platform for collaboration
-Ensures high code quality
e.g of IDEs: visual studio code and vim
e.g of version control: Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges:
-Technical debt
-Tight deadline
-Changing requirement
Solutions
-Code Reviews
-Time Management
-Agile Methodology

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit-testing done on individual module
Intergration-testing of sub-systems
system testing-testing of the entire software
Acceptance testing-testing if it meets user's needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this is crafting questions and statement to get best possible results from AI

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"What is software engineering"
"Describe briefly what is Software Engineering noting only the important points"
